def day2datetime(queried_day: int):
    """
    Accepts a day-of-month. Returns datetime object equivalent.

    The motivation for this method is that the tideschart.com weekly
    tides tables display only a day-of-month integer. This DOM-
    rendered table displays these day-of-month values relative to the
    current day. Therefore, it is possible to determine the actual
    date referenced by each of these day-of-month numbers.

    For example, if the user visits the table on 7/4/2022 and is
    presented with tides data for the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th,
    9th and 10th of the month, we know these are all relative to
    7/4/2022.

    This method uses this knowlege to convert a day-of-month integer
    from the weekly tides table to a Python datetime value.

    Appropriate handling of month overflow and year overflow
    conditions are fully supported.
